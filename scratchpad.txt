10% capital gains tax 
1000 * .10 = 100
100  * .01 = 10
10   * .01 = 1

   111 total capital gains tax
  1111 total withdrawn
  
  1000 / (1 - .10) - 1000 = 111
  
  ------
  Fix primitive obsession
  Make sure nextYear() is setting all variables properly -- need to carry forward capital gains, for example
  Calculate endingCapitalGains()
  
  
  
  
  Consider what to do about withdrawing more than the starting balance - assert that
  this is impossible ?
  Fix SavingsAccountYearTest.newAccount abstraction -- use it or don't !
  We're passing in capitalGainsTaxRate everywhere -- put it in constructor ?
  --------
  ch10 totalWithdrawnExceptCapitalGainsTax() is refactored from  totalWithdrawn()
  ---
  Eliminate totalWithdrawnExcptCapitalGains() ?
